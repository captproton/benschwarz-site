# sinatra-shell

Sintra shell is the framework that I put together for how I believe sinatra "Just Worksâ„¢" in my brain.
It doesn't give you anything fancy, nor special, it just works for me.

I pulled this framework from my project "[amnesia](http://github.com/benschwarz/amnesia/)" after realising that I was creating exactly the same structure again.

Using rubigen or anything similar felt too much like hard work, but feel free to do so and sent those pull requests!

## How to run it

    rackup config.ru
or 
    
    ruby app.rb
or using rtomayko's "[shotgun](http://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun/tree/master)"

    shotgun config.ru
    
Go and write some fucking sinatra apps!
