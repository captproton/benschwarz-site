# My new web site

## Shiney object syndrome or "magpie"
As of writing, this has been sitting on my desktop for well over a month. I tend to write
ass loads new projects after starting a new personal project. This is exactly what happened.


By making this public I may feel the need to actually finish it sometime. 
You can thank [smoke](http://github.com/benschwarz/smoke) for distracting me.

For now my [existing site](http://germanforblack.com) will continue to run in-cache - That is: 
  Mephisto hasn't been running for well over a year on my slice, hence some pages not working,
  although most exist in cache. Hows that for system resources?
  
## Some stats regarding this web site
  * Sinatra
  * HAML (yeah, I said its gross and I stand by it. I got helpers for free and coded smoke instead. bite me.)
  * Uses Yahoo pipes for content delivery from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/benschwarz), [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/benschwarz) and [Delicious](http://delicious.com/bschwarz). Then whatever web service I decide to bolt in later.
  * The yahoo pipe being used might be replaced with [smoke](http://github.com/benschwarz/smoke)
  * The layout is a glimpse into the future (HTML 5)
  * I started using [sinatra-shell](http://github.com/benschwarz/sinatra-shell)
  
"magpie" is what my girlfriend has nicknamed [our cat Casper](http://www.flickr.com/photos/benschwarz/3190002939/) who tends to "magpie" our shiny objects / jewelry.
Much like a [magpie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Magpie).
