      :smartypants
        I was born and still live in Melbourne, Australia. However I have aspirations to travel the world and live subsidised entirely via a laptop.  

        Here in Melbourne I work for myself, I love what I do and constantly strive to improve my process and knowledge. 
        Every facet of my professional practice emcompasses _"humane design"_, whether it be architechure, storyboarding or code. 
        Currently, I manage projects using something _like_ agile and most of development work is conducted using BDD and/or TDD, depending on the flavor of project.      

        My language of choice is Ruby, however my skills cross the chasm of various open source technologies and front end development.        
      
        If you have a project in mind please feel free to drop me a line to discuss. If I can't help you chances are I'll know someone who can.
